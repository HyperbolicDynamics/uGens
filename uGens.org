- 230120 keep on section 2 of
  https://github.com/supercollider/example-plugins/blob/master/README.md/ , was
  having trouble setting the cmake -DSC_PATH= ... think it's a windows specific
  issue.
- 240120 success, i had to append / to the path decleration in the makefile.txt
  for it to work on windows, also had to declare path as /mnt/c/users/..... the
  make command spat out a .so file though so i think it might have compiled for
  linux.. checking
